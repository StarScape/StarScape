Software engineer by job title, hacker at heart.

Interested in: envelope-pushing web apps, mobile dev (mostly Android), Lisp (mostly Clojure), reactive UI, functional programming, type systems, WASM, Rust, performance, tools for creativity, and tools for language learning.

I subscribe to the "bicycle for the mind" philosophy of computing. I want to make software that enhances human productivity and joy. I try to contribute back to open source that has done that for me.
