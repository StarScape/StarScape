Software engineer by trade, [hacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture#cite_ref-7) at heart.

Interested in: cutting-edge web apps, offline-first, mobile dev (mostly Android), Lisp (mostly Clojure), snappy low-latency software, reactive UI, functional programming, type systems, WASM, Rust, performance, tools for creativity, and tools for language learning.

I subscribe to the "bicycle for the mind" philosophy of computing. I want to make software that enhances human productivity and joy. I try to contribute back to open source projects that have done that for me.
