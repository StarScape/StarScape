Software engineer.

Interested in: cutting-edge web apps, innovative UX, offline-first, mobile dev (mostly Android), Lisp (mostly Clojure), snappy low-latency software, reactive UI, functional programming, type systems, WASM, Rust, performance, tools for creativity, and tools for language learning.

I subscribe to the "bicycle for the mind" philosophy of computing. I want to make software that enhances users' productivity and joy. I try to contribute back to open source projects that have done that for me.

I'm the developer of [Droplet](https://www.dropletwriter.com/), an Electron-based word processor that attempts to fix the things I don't like about word processors. It's currently in beta.
