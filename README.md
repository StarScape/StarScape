Interested in: envelope-pushing web apps, mobile dev (primarily Android), reactive UI, functional programming, type systems, Lisp/Clojure, WASM, Rust, tools for (human) language learning, and performance.

I subscribe to the "bicycle for the mind" philosophy of computing. I want to make software that enhances human productivity and joy, not that mines our attention spans to extract as many dollars as possible. I try to contribute back to open source that has improved my life.
