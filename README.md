Software dev interested in:

* Boundary-pushing web apps
* Offline-first, innovative UX, and performance as a feature
* Lisp, Clojure, functional programming, reactive UI paradigms, and type systems that don't suck
* Rust and WASM
* Tools for creativity and learning

I subscribe to the "bicycle for the mind" philosophy of computing. I want to make software that enhances users' productivity and joy. I try to contribute back to open source projects that have done that for me.

I'm the developer of [Droplet](https://www.dropletwriter.com/), an rich text editor that attempts to fix the things I don't like about rich text editors. It's currently in alpha and has a long way to go.

> What they had in common was mainly love of excellence and programming. They wanted to make their programs that they used be as good as they could. They also wanted to make them do neat things. They wanted to be able to do something in a more exciting way than anyone believed possible and show "Look how wonderful this is. I bet you didn't believe this could be done." <sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240727050620/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_Wizards_of_the_Electronic_Age)</sup>
