Full stack web and mobile developer.

Interested in: cutting-edge web apps, innovative UX, offline-first, mobile dev (mostly Android), Lisp (mostly Clojure), snappy low-latency software, reactive UI, functional programming, type systems, WASM, Rust, performance, tools for creativity, and tools for language learning.

I subscribe to the "bicycle for the mind" philosophy of computing. I want to make software that enhances users' productivity and joy. I try to contribute back to open source projects that have done that for me.

I'm the developer of [Droplet](https://www.dropletwriter.com/), an Electron-based word processor that attempts to fix the things I don't like about word processors. It's currently in beta.

> "What they had in common was mainly love of excellence and programming. They wanted to make their programs that they used be as good as they could. They also wanted to make them do neat things. They wanted to be able to do something in a more exciting way than anyone believed possible and show "Look how wonderful this is. I bet you didn't believe this could be done." <sup>[[1]](https://web.archive.org/web/20240727050620/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_Wizards_of_the_Electronic_Age)</sup>
